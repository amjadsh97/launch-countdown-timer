## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library.

## What I Learned

During this project, I reinforced my understanding of manipulating the Date object in JavaScript and effectively creating responsive web applications.

## Continued Development

Moving forward, I am keen to focus on implementing animations,
specifically achieving a flip animation from the center, to enhance
the visual appeal and interactivity of the project.
